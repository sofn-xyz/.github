We're a group of friends who spent the last 8 years building software together at Open Listings then Opendoor. Now we've gone Open Source :).

### Guiding Principles
- *100 year software*
  - Build software that can outlive our company. Today this means we make open source software that can be self-hosted without much centralized support or operations.
- *Sustainable capitalism*
  - Make money so we can do this full-time + ensure our work is valuable. Paying customers are a necessary but not sufficient indicator that we are producing value in the world.
- *Balance*
  - Work hard, but sustainably. Work is one of many things to nurture in our lives and we will produce better work as multi-faceted invididuals.
